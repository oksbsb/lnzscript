lnzscript
==========

LnzScript lets you automate Windows with JavaScript.

![Process.open('notepad.exe'); Time.sleep(500); Keyboard.send('hello!'); Keyboard.send('<Ctrl>s');](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/downpoured/lnzscript/master/shot.png "")

You can script macros for frequently performed actions, write quick one-off scripts in the editor,
and write tests for your software's UI.

*features:*

* 180+ available functions, documented and separated into namespaces
* comes with a full editor + optional autocompletion
* reads/writes/renames files, edits the registry, starts processes and reads their stdout 
* simulates mouse+keyboard actions, and can send input to specific controls by id for better robustness.
* access the clipboard, resize windows, and retrieve text from dialogs.
* and, it's all of this from JavaScript!

*how is this different than AutoIt?*

* the editor has interesting shortcuts, like executing unsaved scripts
* the provided functions are organized into namespaces
* syntax where it is natural to organize code into functions, and not deal with Goto/While/Wend keywords. 
* you can include shared modules with the built-in include() function.

Implemented with win32 api, AutoItX, QtScript, and Qt Toolkit. When I wrote this in 2008, JavaScript mostly ran in the browser, but times have changed.

To run scripts from hotkeys, just install [Clavier+](http://utilfr42.free.fr/util/Clavier.php?sLang=en) (a useful open source tool) and
point it at your script.
